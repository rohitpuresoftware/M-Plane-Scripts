/**
@page bins Binaries

There are a few binaries that are strictly optional since they only use the Sysrepo API. However, they can be
useful for some common tasks and by including them every user does not have to write them from scratch.

- @subpage sysrepo_plugind
- @subpage sysrepoctl
- @subpage sysrepocfg
