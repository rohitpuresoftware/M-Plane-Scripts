/**
@page sysrepo_plugind sysrepo-plugind

This application is a simple daemon that groups all available Sysrepo plugins into a single process. What is a plugin
from an abstract perspective is explained on the [introductory](@ref about) page. This daemon loads plugins
from **plugins path** directory and supports a few options, `--verbosity` for logging and `--debug` to not go into
daemon mode and keep printing all messages to `stderr`.

## Sysrepo Plugin

Plugin is a shared object that must expose 2 functions, `sr_plugin_init_cb()` and `sr_plugin_cleanup_cb()` that are
called on _sysrepo-plugind_ start and end, respectively. The initialization function must perform all the run-time
tasks because no other function will be called by the daemon. It usually involves creating various subscriptions
that then handle events on their own. Cleanup usually stops these subscriptions. There is also a working detailed
[plugin example](@ref oven_plugin).

## Plugins Path
@anchor plugins_path

This is the path where plugins should be stored and nothing else. The default one can be changed during compilation
(`PLUGINS_PATH` option) but `$SRPD_PLUGINS_PATH` environment variable will always overwrite this default path, if set.
